Heartlight PC Creative Commons release README.TXT file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Release information

This 2006 release has been recompiled by one of the authors (Maciej
Miasik www.miasik.net) from the original source files using the DOSBox
emulator (dosbox.sourceforge.net), and it is intended to be run using
such emulation. This release has not been tested on a genuine DOS
PC machine. Use at your own risk.

The game has been released with the permission of the copyright
holders.

The original game was developed by Xland and was released worldwide in
1994 by Epic Games. Epic Games played no role and bears no responsibility
for this Creative Commons release and does not provide any support for it
whatsoever.

following commands (assuming the game has been extracted to C:\HL):

III. Playing the game

Guide the dwarf through each of 70 levels and collect the required number
of hearts to open the door leading to the next level. The numbers in the
bottom left of the screen show the required number of hearts and the
number of the hearts collected so far. You have infinite lives.

The game offers 3 player slots. Each of them can be named and used to
keep score (number of completed levels). Press ENTER while in the
title screen to select the player's slot and change its name. You can
finish levels in any order.

previous or next level, respectively.

Level editing
-------------

Heartlight PC allows user-created levels to be added to the game. The
levels are defined in a plain text file named LEVELS.HL. This file can
be edited with any plain text editor (e.g. Notepad, but not MS Word or
other similar word processors). Simply open this file in Notepad and edit
one of the existing level definitions, or add a new one. The format of
this file is self-explanatory, and there is a small legend at the
beginning of the file.
